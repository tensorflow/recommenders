For example, an e-commerce site may record user visits to product pages (abundant, but relatively low signal), image clicks, adding to cart, and, finally, purchases. It may even record post-purchase signals such as reviews and returns.\n",

This is especially true where some data is abundant (for example, clicks), and some data is sparse (purchases, returns, manual reviews). In those scenarios, a joint model may be able to use representations learned from the abundant task to improve its predictions on the sparse task via a phenomenon known as [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). For example, [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJxPVcSonN) shows that a model predicting explicit user ratings from sparse user surveys can be substantially improved by adding an auxiliary task that uses abundant click log data.\n",
