  """Dot interaction layer.

  See theory in the DLRM paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00091.pdf,
  section 2.1.3. Sparse activations and dense activations are combined.
  Dot interaction is applied to a batch of input Tensors [e1,...,e_k] of the
  same dimension and the output is a batch of Tensors with all distinct pairwise
  dot products of the form dot(e_i, e_j) for i <= j if self_interaction is
  True, otherwise dot(e_i, e_j) i < j.

  Attributes:
    self_interaction: Boolean indicating if features should self-interact.
      If it is True, then the diagonal enteries of the interaction matric are
      also taken.
    skip_gather: An optimization flag. If it's set then the upper triangle part
      of the dot interaction matrix dot(e_i, e_j) is set to 0. The resulting
      activations will be of dimension [num_features * num_features] from which
      half will be zeros. Otherwise activations will be only lower triangle part
      of the interaction matrix. The later saves space but is much slower.
    name: String name of the layer.
