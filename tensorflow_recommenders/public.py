"""TensorFlow Recommenders is a library for building recommender system models.

It helps with the full workflow of building a recommender system: data
preparation, model formulation, training, evaluation, and deployment.

It's built on Keras and aims to have a gentle learning curve while still giving
you the flexibility to build complex models.

This is a public version of the library and hence does not include
internal google stuff.
