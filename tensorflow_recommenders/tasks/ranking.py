  """A ranking task.

  Recommender systems are often composed of two components:
  - a retrieval model, retrieving O(thousands) candidates from a corpus of
    O(millions) candidates.
  - a ranker model, scoring the candidates retrieved by the retrieval model to
    return a ranked shortlist of a few dozen candidates.

  This task helps with building ranker models. Usually, these will involve
  predicting signals such as clicks, cart additions, likes, ratings, and
  purchases. Accordingly, this task is less prescriptive than tfrs.Retrieval
  on how you generate "relevance" scores from query- and candidate-embeddings.
  Your model is expected to call tfrs.tasks.Ranking with scores and labels
  rather than factorized embeddings.
