  Recommender systems are often composed of two components:
  - a retrieval model, retrieving O(thousands) candidates from a corpus of
    O(millions) candidates.
  - a ranker model, scoring the candidates retrieved by the retrieval model to
    return a ranked shortlist of a few dozen candidates.

  This task defines models that facilitate efficient retrieval of candidates
  from large corpora by maintaining a two-tower, factorized structure: separate
  query and candidate representation towers, joined at the top via a lightweight
  scoring function.
